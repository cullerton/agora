Agora is a forum for ideas. It is a simple blog-like application developed for a class curriculum, and is not intended for real deployment, although it could serve some purpose.

Agora uses SQLAlchemy for a persistence layer. There are two classes--Author and Idea, that have a one-to-many/many-to-one relationship. Author.ideas are Idea.ids and Idea.author is an Author.id.

You must pass an SQLAlchemy session to initialize agora. An example session is provided in session.py.

Usage:

>>> from agora import Agora, DBSession
>>> forum = Agora(DBSession)
>>> forum.get_ideas()
[First Idea!, Another Idea!]
